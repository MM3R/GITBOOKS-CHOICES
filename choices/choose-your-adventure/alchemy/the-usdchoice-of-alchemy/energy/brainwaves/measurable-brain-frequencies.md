# Measurable brain frequencies

## <mark style="background-color:orange;">gamma waves (38-42 hertz)</mark>



* Once thought to be random brain noises, gammas are the fastest brainwave states.
* Monks, yogis, and deep meditation practitioners display this brain frequency when meditating.

## <mark style="background-color:purple;">beta waves (12-28 hertz)</mark>



* These frequencies are seen when a player is awake and alert.&#x20;
* This is the most common brainwave state that players engage in.
* Excitement, anxiety, stress, decision-making, critical thinking, and focused attention are associated with beta.

## <mark style="background-color:green;">alpha waves (7.5-13 hertz)</mark>



* These frequencies occur while players are relaxing, meditating, and daydreaming.
* Alpha has access to the subconscious mind and occurs when players are receiving information passively, such as learning.
