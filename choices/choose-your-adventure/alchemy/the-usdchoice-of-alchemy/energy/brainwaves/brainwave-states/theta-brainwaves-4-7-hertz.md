# Theta brainwaves (4-7Â hertz)

<mark style="background-color:orange;"></mark>

### <mark style="color:purple;">Theta brainwave activity is a very relaxed state, representing the twilight zone between waking and sleep. These waves are present when players are dreaming and at higher states of meditation.</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">Theta brainwaves are a gateway to learning, memory, and intuition. They produce a spacey state of mind associated with mental inefficiency and psych experiences: in this state, direct logic is suppressed, and communication is conveyed through symbols or abstract messages.</mark>
