## <mark style="background-color:red;">Recommendations</mark>

<mark style="background-color:green;"></mark>

1. **Spend days observing and taking notes of how long a similar-started flame usually takes to burn by itself when you are not focusing.**&#x20;
2. **Pick a day you have slept well, feeling like a highly tuned mind, peaceful but still very energetic and excited.**
3. **Have your hands side by side (but not too close to influence the outcome by physical touch).**&#x20;
4. **Hold the flame as long as you can.**
5. **Take note of how long this flame stayed.**
6. **Do it several times and compare it with 1.**
7. **If you noticed a very significant delta (difference), then **<mark style="color:red;">**you have achieved the Magick skill of pyrokinesis**</mark>**.**
8. **The sky is the limit (not literarily).**

## <mark style="background-color:purple;">Further recommendations</mark>

<mark style="background-color:purple;"></mark>

* **We don't tell how many times is enough to convince you or what's a significant delta. You already know.**
* **This is an advanced skill.**&#x20;
* **We are not responsible or liable for any dire consequences or damage if you try this experiment at home.**&#x20;
* **I mean, this is the internet.**
