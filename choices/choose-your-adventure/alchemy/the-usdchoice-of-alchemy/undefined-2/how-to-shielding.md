1. **if you can, just cut the cord out: physically block, remove, unfollow.**
2. **If you can't physically remove the influence for now, make a plan to be able to do this in the future. Do not stay in a situation that chronically attacks your well-being and your free will.**
3. **Realize your mind's inertia: every time this person or energy appears inside your mind, acknowledge it and then, gently, move away to your own thoughts and happy spaces.**

5. **Feel free to delete messaging apps from your devices as long as you need time within.**
