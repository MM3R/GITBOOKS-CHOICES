### <mark style="background-color:green;">The first locus theme is the player's mind and body, including appearance and personality.</mark>

### <mark style="background-color:green;">The first locus is the filter the player wears to see reality, and how the player articulates who they are.</mark>

In this case, the player is not only playing for the Virgo team, but also reasoning each of the following 11th loci under the Virgo team's rationale (at least at the highest level, without considering yet the planets' influence).</mark>
